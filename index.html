                    <summary>Why is this here?</summary>
                    <p>
                         This is just a DnD dice roller I made because I wanted to do like the rest of one of
                         my DnD groups and make something related to DnD. I'm not much of an artisan, so I
                         figured I'd write some code.

                    <p>
                         If you're reading this because you actually need help, then I failed because it was
                         supposed to be fairly intuitive.
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         You select dice by clicking/tapping them at the top of the page. The selected dice show up in a
                         box below. You click roll when you've selected what dice you want to roll and at what quantity.
                         <br />
                         If you want to remove a die from your selected list, you just click/tap it, and it will be
                         removed.

                    <summary>About Me (as a developer)</summary>
                    <p>
                         I'm a software developer who has been in the game for about 10 years as of summer 2024.
                         <br />
                         I like minimalistic approaches to code, in that I like to use fewer libraries and frameworks in
                         situations where I don't they are called for. I have nothing against various libraries (except
                         for react.js, I greatly dislike react.js),
                         I just tend to not a see a need for them in my day to day work, especially for trivial
                         applications like this one. If you stumbled upon this, I hope you found some use out of it, or
                         at least didn't feel as though you wasted your time.

                    <summary>About Me (as a person)</summary>
                    <p>
                         Aside from software development, I'm a fairly plain guy who serves the Lord Jesus
                         Christ wherever I can.
                         <br />
                         I can play a couple of instruments and am in both of my Church's worship bands. (this is
                         starting to sound like a bio from the early 2000's internet).

                    <summary>The Gospel</summary>
                    <p>
                         This is the gospel (good news of Jesus Christ) told through what is commonly called the
                         "Roman Road", which is a collection of verses from the book of Romans.
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         <strong>Romans 3:23 &mdash;</strong>
                         "&hellip;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&hellip;"
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         <strong>Romans 5:8 &mdash;</strong>
                         "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died
                         for us."
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         <strong>Romans 6:23 &mdash;</strong>
                         "For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus
                         our Lord."
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         <strong>Romans 8:1 &mdash;</strong>
                         "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christâ€¦"
                         <br />
                         <br />
                         <strong>Romans 10:9-10 &mdash;</strong>
                         "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him
                         from the dead, you will be saved. One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and
                         one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation."
